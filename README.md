# HWID Collector (Inspired By Rio) 

A **borderless** PowerShell script that collects your **IGN** and HWID (CPU, Memory, Disk) with a **dark**, draggable UI.

**Usage**  
1. Run powershell as admin and paste this code in  ```powershell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process; Invoke-Expression (Invoke-RestMethod 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skiedlmao/HwidChecker/main/hwid.ps1')"``` 
2. Enter IGN.  
3. Click “Collect HWID Info.”  
4. Click “Close” or “✕” to exit.
